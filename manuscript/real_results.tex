\section{Applications to field data}
\label{sec:real_data}

In this section, we show the applications of the iterative (Algorithm \ref{alg:TOB20-22}) and direct 
(equations \ref{eq:direct-deconvolution} and \ref{eq:matrix-L-Wiener-deconvolution}) deconvolutions to field data sets 
over the Caraj{\'a}s Mineral Province (CMP) in the Amazon craton \citep{moroni-etal2001,villas-santos2001}. 
This area is known for its intensive mineral exploration such as iron, copper, gold, manganese, and, recently, bauxite.

\subsection{Geological setting}

The Amazon Craton is one of the largest and least-known Archean-Proterozoic areas in the world, comprehending a region with a thousand square kilometers. 
It is one of the main tectonic units in South America, which is covered by five Phanerozoic basins: 
Maranh{\~a}o (Northeast), Amazon (Central), Xingu-Alto Tapaj{\'o}s (South), Parecis (Southwest), and Solim{\~o}es (West). 
The Craton is limited by the Andean Orogenic Belt to the west and the by Araguaia Fold Belt to the east and southeast. 
The Amazon craton has been subdivided into provinces according to two models, one geochronological and the other geophysical-structural 
\citep{amaral1974, teixeira-etal1989, tassinari-macambira1999}. Thus, seven geological provinces with distinctive ages, evolution, and structural 
patterns can be observed, namely: (i) Caraj{\'a}s with two domains - the Mesoarchean Rio Maria and Neoarchean Caraj{\'a}s; 
(ii) Archean-Paleoproterozoic Central Amazon, with Iriri-Xingu and Curuá-Mapuera domains; (ii) Trans-Amazonian (Ryacian), with the Amap{\'a} 
and Bacaj{\'a} domains; (iv) the Orosinian Tapaj{\'o}s-Parima, with Peixoto de Azevedo, Tapaj{\'o}s, Uaimiri, and Parima domains; 
(v) Rond{\^o}nia-Juruena (Statherian), with Jamari, Juruena, and Jauru domains; (vi) The Statherian Rio Negro, with Rio Negro and 
Imeri domains; and (vii) Suns{\'a}s (Meso-Neoproterozoic), with Santa Helena and Nova Brasil{\^a}ndia domains \citep{santos-etal2000}. 
Nevertheless, we focus this work only on the Caraj{\'a}s Province. 

The Caraj{\'a}s Mineral Province (CMP) is located in the east-southeast region of the craton, within an old tectonically stable nucleus in the 
South American Plate that became tectonically stable at the beginning of Neoproterozoic \citep{salomao-etal2019}. 
This area has been the target of intensive exploration at least since the final of the '60s, after the discovery of large iron ore deposits. 
There are several greenstone belts in the region, among them are the Andorinhas, Inajá, Cumaru, Caraj{\'a}s, Serra Leste, Serra Pelada, and Sapucaia 
\citep{santos-etal2000}. The mineralogic and petrologic studies in granite stocks show a variety of minerals found in the province, such as 
amphibole, plagioclase, biotite, ilmenite, and magnetite \citep{cunha-etal2016}. 

\subsection{Potential-field data}

The field data used here were acquired obtained from an airborne survey conducted by Lasa Prospec{\c c}{\~o}es S/A. 
and Microsurvey Aerogeof{\'i}sica Consultoria Cient{\'i}fica Ltda. between April/2013 and October/2014.
The survey area covers $\approx 58000 \: \mathrm{km}^2$ with high-resolution gravity data. 
The flight and the tie lines were acquired and spaced at $3 \: \mathrm{km}$  and $12 \: \mathrm{km}$ oriented in the 
directions $N-S$ and $E-W$, respectively, with a mean flight height of $900 \: \mathrm{m}$ above the ground. 
Figure %\ref{fig:}  
shows the interpolated aerogravimetric data in a grid of 
$1000 \times 500$ ($D = 500,000$ observation points) at the same mean flight height. 
%About the computational resources, we processed both data on an Intel Core i7 7700HQ@2.8 GHz processor and 16GB RAM. 


\subsection{Applications}

%PAREI AQUI

In all applications, we set the same equivalent sources layout with one source located below each datum
(so $P=D$) on a horizontal plane distant $1200 \: \mathrm{m}$ from the observations.
This setup is composed by a grid of $1000 \times 500$ equivalent sources ($M = 500,000$). 
%positioned below the observation plane, but a different depth in each application.
%We set a depth for the equivalent layer equal to $1200 \, m$ below the observation plane. 

For performing the upward continuation of the gravimetric data (Figure \ref{fig:9}) over CMP in the Amazon craton, we apply the two equivalent-layer methods (iterative and direct deconvolutions).
By applying the iterative and direct deconvolutions, we estimated density distributions (not shown)
that produced the predicted gravimetric data shown, respectively, in  Figures \ref{fig:10}A and C.
The gravimetric residuals obtained by  both the iterative (Figure \ref{fig:10}B) and
direct (Figure \ref{fig:10}D) deconvolutions are close to zero for most of the survey area
indicating that both methods achieve acceptable data fittings.
For the iterative deconvolution, the residuals have a mean of $\approx 0.0005$ mGal and a standard deviation 
of $\approx 0.16$ mGal.
For the direct deconvolution, the mean and standard deviation of the residuals are $\approx 0.46$ mGal and 
$\approx 1.23$ mGal, respectively. 
We stress that the residuals from the direct deconvolution (Figure \ref{fig:10}D) are greater than  
the iterative deconvolution (Figure \ref{fig:10}B).
A possible reason for this difference may be  the border effects.
Figures \ref{fig:10}E and F show the upward-continued gravimetric data at a height of $-3500 \: \mathrm{m}$
by using the iterative and direct deconvolutions, respectively.
Considering the processing time, the iterative and direct deconvolutions took  $\approx 9.18 \: \mathrm{s}$ and $\approx 0.53 \: \mathrm{s}$, respectively. 
These results demonstrate the efficiency of both the iterative and direct deconvolution methods in processing large gravimetric datasets from extensive areas with dense data coverage. 
It is worth noting that the direct deconvolution method exhibits faster processing times compared to the iterative deconvolution, which aligns with expectations


%\section{Real data application}
%\label{sec:real_data}

%Gridded data of 1000x500 (500000 observed points) for both grav and mag. Data is at -900m.

%Grav equivalent layer depth is 300 m and 50 iterations of the cgls method was used.
%Mag equivalent layer depth is 0 m and 200 iterations of the cgls method was used.

%On an Intel Core i7 7700HQ@2.8 GHz processor in single processing and single-threading modes
%the gravimetric equivalent layer took $9.19$ seconds to estimate the equivalent sources with the convolutional method and $0.51$ seconds with the deconvolutional method. 
%
%The magnetic equivalent layer took $82$ seconds to estimate the equivalent sources with the convolutional method and $0.84$ seconds with the deconvolutional method.
%
%As Carajás area is very large different values of the magnetic main field can be considered. 
%The main field declination was calculated using the tool in the website (for the date 01/01/2014): https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/geomag/calculators/magcalc.shtml
%For this application I considered an approximated mid location of the area (latitude $-6.55^{\circ}$ and longitude $-50.75^{\circ})$. The declination is $-19.865^{\circ}$ and the inclination $-7.43915^{\circ}$.
%As the source magnetization is unknown inclination and declination equal to the main field is being used for all the equivalent sources.
